# development utilities

### library setup

`set-pythonpath.sh` is a script that adds a directory to the python path for the current shell session, useful for developing libraries that are not installed in the system python path

_e.g. adds `lab2/src` to the python path for the current shell session_
```bash
source dev/set-pythonpath.sh lab2/src
```
