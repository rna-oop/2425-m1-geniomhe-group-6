## Modeling a Library for the Manipulation of Ribonucleic Acids (RNAs)
The goal of this series of labs is to build a library that allows easy manipulation and study of RNA sequences.
This course is around object-oriented programming principles. Therefore, besides complying with the use case specificities, particular attention will be paid to the quality of the proposed model in terms of extensibility, i.e., the ability of a system to be effortlessly expanded or adjusted with new features without needing major alterations to the current codebase. Indeed, you have to conceive your models while keeping in mind that the following labs will impact your current modeling. In other words, change is inevitable, but you have to minimize the amount of it.
